This file describes the format of files in the items directory.

Each file consists of several properties of the item, seperated by newlines.
The properties are name, type, quality, price, value, description, and picture.
Each property is given in the format Property=Value. An example item is given
below.

type=17
#Type 0 is weapons, 1 is armor, 2 is shield, 3 is helmet, 4 is gloves,
#5 is boots.
#Type 10 is unusable (use for story items/keys), 11 is healing, 12 is
#explosive, 14 is gems, and 15-17 is scripted (15=usable in battle,
#16=usable out of battle, 17=usable in both).
quality=5

#This value is unused in items of type 10, and 15-17, but is still visible in
#stores, and anytime an item is described.
price=10
value=10
#Price is the cost to buy an item, and value is the selling price. If both are
#0, you cannot sell or drop the item.
