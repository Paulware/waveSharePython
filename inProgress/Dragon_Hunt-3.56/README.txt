Dragon Hunt 3.56

Changed:
Changed the level loading code a bit. The world map in Dark Ages should now be faster.
Fixed a couple small bugs. (Bugreports by Lukas Sabota)
The game will use Psyco if available. This greatly speeds up loading time.
Added options screen.
Added joystick support. (Lukas Sabota for suggestion)

Requirements:
Recent version of Python, and Pygame. This game should work on Linux,
Windows, and Mac OSX (and any other OS that supports Python and Pygame) as
long as the preceeding requirements are met. However, all development was done
in Linux, so glitchs may be present in OSX and Windows.

Running the game:
on Linux, running the shell script "Dragon_Hunt_Linux" will start the game. On
other platforms, type "python rpg.py" from the code directory.

Playing the game:
Keyboard default buttons:
Use the arrow keys to move, enter for actions, and esc for leaving a screen.

Mouse:
Click in the direction you want to move. All buttons/lists/etc should work as
expected.

Shortcuts:
i (or Enter): opens the inventory from the main screen
s: saves in main screen
q: quits in main screen
a: attacks in battle
